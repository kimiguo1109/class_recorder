## 🎤 Step 1: Voice Registration Sample

> **Purpose**: Read this first to register professor's voice  
> **Duration**: ~10 seconds

**👨‍🏫 Professor says:**

Hello everyone, I'm Professor Smith. Today we'll be learning about the fundamentals of calculus. Calculus is a very important branch of mathematics that studies rates of change and accumulation. I hope you'll listen carefully and ask questions actively.

### 【Opening】Professor Introduces Topic

**👨‍🏫 Professor:**

Alright class, today we're going to learn about the concept of derivatives. Derivatives are one of the most fundamental concepts in calculus. Simply put, a derivative describes the rate of change of a function at a particular point.

*(Pause 2 seconds)*

For example, imagine a car traveling along a road. Its position changes continuously over time. If we want to know the car's velocity at any given moment, we need to use derivatives.

### 【Interaction 1】Student Question

**🧑‍🎓 Student A:**

Professor, what's the relationship between derivatives and slopes?

*(Pause 2 seconds)*

**👨‍🏫 Professor:**

That's an excellent question! Actually, the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the function's curve at a specific point. You learned about slopes of straight lines in high school, right? Derivatives extend this concept to curves.

*(Pause 2 seconds)*

For a straight line, the slope is constant. But for a curve, the slope can be different at every point. The derivative is the tool we use to calculate the slope at any point on the curve.

### 【Deep Dive】Professor Gives Example

**👨‍🏫 Professor:**

Let me give you a concrete example. Suppose we have a function f(x) equals x squared. What is the derivative when x equals two?

*(Pause 2 seconds)*

According to the differentiation rules, the derivative of x squared equals two x. So when x equals two, the derivative equals four. This means at the point where x equals two, the slope of the tangent line is four.

### 【Interaction 2】Student Question

**🧑‍🎓 Student B:**

Professor, I'm still a bit confused. What are some real-world applications of derivatives?

*(Pause 2 seconds)*

**👨‍🏫 Professor:**

Great question! Derivatives have many practical applications in real life. For instance:

First, in physics, velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity.

Second, in economics, marginal cost and marginal revenue are both calculated using derivatives.

Third, in machine learning, we use gradient descent to optimize models, and gradient is essentially the derivative of multivariable functions.

### 【Summary】Class Conclusion

**👨‍🏫 Professor:**

Alright, today we learned the basic concept of derivatives. Remember, a derivative is essentially the rate of change of a function, and geometrically it represents the slope of the tangent line.

*(Pause 2 seconds)*

Next class we'll learn about differentiation rules. Please review today's material and work on the practice problems in your textbook.
